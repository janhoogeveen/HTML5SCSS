## What is HTML5SCSS
Take the HTML5 Boilerplate. Take SCSS. Mix them together and you have HTML5SCSS. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Why did you make it?
Lately all the projects I work on are developed in SCSS. They are also always based on the HTML5 Boilerplate. I think it's silly to refactor every new release of the boilerplate to my likings. This project ensures I spend a minimum of time setting up new projects.

## Why should I use it?
* Less time setting up your environment.
* Faster coding
* Easier maintenance through SCSS.

## Any changes to the original boilerplate?
- Chromeframe is removed from the code because I don't use it.
- I've added Bourbon by default. It provides a very nice set of clean CSS3 mixins. I prefer using it over Compass. If you don't, it's very easy to remove from the project.

## Thanks
My thanks to the HTML5 Boilerplate contributors and the Sass team.
